# Conjecture: Reductionist Scope

The first step into getting a clear, complete, and rational picture about cybersecurity and privacy preservation is to
define the scope of the system we want to feel at peace about. Because cyber systems can be exhaustively broken apart in
layers of distinct interacting components, a reductionist approach to cybersecurity and privacy ensures overall peace of
mind.

Since we are talking about cybersecurity and privacy preservation in a _cyber_ context, the borders of any system we
focus on can be defined crisply: cyber systems are human constructs, and extremely binary. There is no vague or
contested periphery, which makes protection more difficult in the material world. The different entities that make up a
cyber system are distinct, and each is either part of the system or not.

We typically think about cyber systems as consisting of a number of distinct components that interact, and together are
a component in a cyber system at a higher level. At the lowest level we have physical electronic components, the
microcode that runs on them, supporting infrastructure, cables, etcetera. At the highest level we have a surface with
which humans, or other cyber systems outside our control, interact.

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy Preservation are concerns for every component and interaction at
every level. Because of the nature of cyber systems we can be sure that a reductionist approach is complete: if
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy Preservation is considered for every component and interaction
that makes up a cyber system, the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Privacy Preservation of the cyber system
as a whole is completely considered, recursively.
