key: HTTP-Service
name: HTTP Service
scope: >
  An HTTP service is a cyber system that offers endpoints for interaction to clients over the HTTP protocol. It receives
  HTTP requests, handles them, and sends HTTP responses.

  The scope of the risk scenarios for an HTTP Service is code that is under our control, that runs on top of an [HTTP
  Request Handling Stack](../doc/HTTPStack.md).

  The _HTTP Request Handling Stack_ is the whole of hardware networking equipment, hardware computing devices, operating
  system, hyper visor, VM, container, the configuration of all these components, such as firewall and port settings,
  certificates, â€¦,  that exposes an _HTTP Request Handling API_ to code under our control in the service. One example of
  such an _HTTP Request Handling API_ is the API described for AWS Lambda functions invoked through an API Gateway
  endpoint.

  The _HTTP Request Handling Stack_, the entire internet on the other side of the _HTTP Request Handling Stack_, and the
  HTTP Clients that initiate requests, are outside the scope of an HTTP Service these risk scenarios apply to.

  Policies regarding the _HTTP Request Handling Stack_ must exist and be maintained as it and the societal context
  evolves. The policies applicable to the _HTTP Request Handling Stack_ are described elsewhere, and should offer
  reassurance that it preserves CIA&PP on its own, to offer reassurance that the whole cyber system preserves CIA&PP.

  ## Offering Assistance

  The risks of HTTP Clients are outside the scope of HTTP services.

  In general, an HTTP Client executes in a more vulnerable environment that an HTTP service, and there are several ways
  HTTP services an HTTP Client connects to can assist an HTTP Client in preserving CIA&PP. The policies of a resilient
  HTTP Client might demand that it only connects to HTTP services that offer such assistance.

  ## Other components

  Note that an HTTP Service, in general, often also is a Client itself. The HTTP Service code often interacts with other
  downstream components, over HTTP or other protocols. These components and the interactions, if they exist, must be
  covered by additional risk scenarios.

  Examples: HTTP Services that call other HTTP Services, or use a database for persistent storage.

  ## Composition

  The service might be realized by 1 component, or in a layered way, by several subcomponents, in different versions,
  and one or more instances of subcomponents. Traditionally, a service is deployed as 1 or more instances of active
  components that functionally handle HTTP requests, which might be instantiated dynamically to horizontally scale the
  service, behind an API Gateway, or other load balancer. The components that make up the service communicate. Some of
  the components that make up the service are services themselves. Other components might be persistent storage that is
  communicated with using a protocol different from HTTP. Whether some of the components are considered part of the
  service, or peers of the service, is an architectural choice of representation and management, and does not influence
  the governance of the risks of the whole.

  If the architecture is layered, these risk scenarios apply to each HTTP service at every layer.

  The risk scenarios described here concern the behavior of the HTTP service as a whole. The CIA&PP of the whole is the
  CIA&PP of the API, the CIA&PP of each component, and the CIA&PP of all communications. They consider the HTTP service
  to be a black box, and are not concerned with how the behavior is realized. The internal structure and realization of
  the behavior can evolve over time without changes to the external visible behavior, so that different realizations
  must adhere to unchanged policies. The risk assesment and verification of compliance with the policies therefor should
  happen and be repeated for the HTTP service as the whole, considering it a black box.

  ## Structure

  The HTTP Semantics are defined in function of _resources_, identified by URIs. The outside world can interact with an
  HTTP Service by initiating an _action_ on a resource (a.k.a. HTTP methods) as an HTTP request.

  An HTTP request is a communication initiated by a client over the network targeted at the HTTP service, given a
  specific URL, a specific method, meta-data in the HTTP header, and optionally a body.
